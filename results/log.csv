But, I know that many of you are wondering if the ""new"" version is actually a good one because it has been released as an official ROM for Android 4.4 and up (and in some cases even newer) on March 22nd 2016 at 12:02PM UTC. It's not yet available to download from Google Play Store or Amazon Prime Instant Video but there will be more releases soon enough! As always, we hope to see your feedback about this release very much appreciated!!",", i have a shiny mewtwo with the egg moves mewtwo and mewtwo with the egg moves mewtwo and mewtwo with the egg moves mewtwo

hi,facebook/opt-125m,gpt2,", im a little confused about what i should be doing with my life.   i have a job and i want to spend it on a house. i dont know how to make money with this job.

This is the second time in a week that I've been at an event where people have said, ""I'd rather be there than take part.""

They think my performance has helped them out with all of our issues which makes us feel better right","'

How do I make fried rice? ,facebook/opt-125m,gpt2,facebook/opt-125m,"I'm a little confused about how to make them.
You can mix them in your food processor and add water or a bit of salt to taste, but you'll need to use some kind of water-based seasoning.  The recipe calls for adding water, but it's not a substitute.  You could just add the salt and mix it into your rice.","I use the most popular type of frying pan and fry it in a skillet.   It's not really that difficult, but if you're looking for something to start with (such as this one), don't forget to check out my recipe here.
If your batter is very sticky or even grainy then using just 1/4 cup flour may be better than 5 cups each - so add 3 tablespoons at least once per day until all ingredients are well combined into small balls! You can also mix together 2-3 eggs instead because they have different ratios when making them...so keep an eye on how much sugar there has been between","Edit - I'm not saying to use any rice at all, just for this reason.
I'd say try using the same kind of rice as you normally would. It's much better than chicken or rice with no additives, but it doesn't have a lot of flavor and is pretty cheap.",,,,2024-04-05 21:06:41.560529
What are the 5 best sci fi books? ,facebook/opt-125m,gpt2,facebook/opt-125m,"The best sci fi books of all time are The Dark Knight Returns and The Matrix.

The Matrix is also my favorite movie ever, it's like watching a movie where the characters are so different that they just have to be the same person for every scene.

They're all pretty interesting and have a lot of fun to read, but I'd recommend reading them before you start looking for a sci fi book.
